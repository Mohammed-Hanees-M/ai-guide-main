Place your profile image file here so the site uses it in the Hero section.

1) Save the attached image from the chat as `profile.jpg` in this folder:
   src/assets/profile.jpg

2) Restart the dev server if it's running:

   # powershell
   npm run dev

Notes:
- The component `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` now imports `@/assets/profile.jpg`.
- If you'd rather keep a PNG, name the file `profile.png` and update the import in `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` accordingly.
- If you want me to add the image file for you, reply "Please add the image" and I'll save it into `src/assets/profile.jpg` using the attachment you provided.
